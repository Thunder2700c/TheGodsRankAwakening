      <p><em>October 21, 2120, CE</em></p>
      <p>That day was a change in the life of killers.</p>
      <p class="dialogue">
        “No, No, Nooooo, I will not die, I will... kill him, cut down... his head.”
        A final battle starts, the Sword and Two-Sided Dagger of Asura King
        Kanasura strike, emerging heavy fire sparks.
      </p>
      <p class="dialogue">
        <strong>Kanasura says:</strong> “This is the right time, put your weapons down and work
        for me and I will spare your life.”
      </p>
      <p class="dialogue">
        <strong>Aditya replies:</strong> “Work for you? No way in hell. My goal is to take your
        head, and I will not stop until I chop your head.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sky was crimson red, land full of ruins and blood, dead bodies of all
        soldiers surrounded everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The killer staggered amid the crimson ruins, shadows flickering at his
        core like a killer’s awakening system, killing intent surging beyond mortal
        limits. Blood stained the grounds, but his eyes burned with defiance as
        Kanasura circled, spear gleaming with infernal light.
      </p>
      <p class="dialogue">
        <strong>Kanasura said:</strong> “I think you will not understand.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Asura King snarled, lunging forward with blinding speed, thrusting the
        spear straight toward the killer’s midsection, poised to pierce between
        stomach and chest in a fatal strike that could end it all...
