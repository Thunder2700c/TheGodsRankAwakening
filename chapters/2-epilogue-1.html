  <!-- Chapter Content -->
  <main class="chapter-content">
    <p>The dim glow of enchanted lanterns flickered across the dusty shelves of Armaan Singh’s library, casting long shadows over ancient tomes and relics. The old man, in his late fifties, bore every wrinkle and grey streak that told a story of time. Slumped in his favorite armchair, he watched his servant prepare his favourite herbal tea.</p>

    <p>It was a quiet evening. Armaan murmured, “Back in the old days, quiet was a luxury... or a curse.”</p>

    <p>A sharp ring echoed through the house — the doorbell, insistent and out of place in the stillness. He heaved himself up, joints creaking like old hinges, and opened the door.</p>

    <p>With a twist of the knob, the door opened, revealing a young man in his late twenties standing on the threshold. Tall, sharp-featured, with long golden hair that caught the evening light and eyes that sparkled like polished diamond. But there was an air of quiet intensity about him, like a storm cloud holding back lightning.</p>

    <p>Armaan blinked, squinting against the fading sunset. “Who are you? State your business, lad.”</p>

    <p>The young man tilted his head, a faint, knowing smile playing on his lips. Before he could respond, Armaan’s eyes widened, tracing the familiar lines in the stranger’s face.</p>

    <p>Armaan said, “Hold on... I think I’ve seen you before. No, not you exactly, but those features — they scream of my old comrade-in-arms, Aditya Sharma. The man who could stare down a monster from hell and make it blink first. You — his kin or something? A long-lost cousin peddling family heirlooms?”</p>

    <p>The young man’s smile deepened; his voice carried weight. “You are sharper than you look, chacha (Uncle) Armaan. I am the one who’s been chasing the most precious thing in my life, lost to time and betrayal. I’m strong on the outside, forged in battles that would break lesser men, but inside... I am the son of your old friend Aditya Sharma. My name is Abhijeet Sharma. Nice to meet you, Armaan Chacha.”</p>

    <p>Armaan froze — the words hit him like slamming into a collapsing estate wall. “Aditya’s son... Oh my God, you are alive! Where have you been all these years?”</p>

    <p>His mind flooded with memories of the days Armaan and Aditya shared; his eyes filled with tears.</p>

    <p>“Chacha ji, are you okay? Why are you crying?” the young man asked.</p>

    <p>“Yes, my boy.” <em>*He hugged him tightly.*</em> “I am just so happy — tears have started flowing. I’m so glad you’re okay. Come in, think of this as your own home.”</p>

    <p>They settled down.</p>

    <p>“Can I ask you some things? Oh wait — sorry, I forgot to offer you a drink. What would you like — tea, coffee, juice, cold drink?”</p>

    <p>“I guess a cup of tea would be nice.”</p>

    <p>Armaan ordered his servant to bring tea as per Abhijeet’s request. For a moment he thought even the drinking preferences were just like Aditya’s.</p>

    <p>“Answer me a few things. Where were you these past years? Who took care of you? And what is the most precious thing you are trying to find?”</p>

    <p>“Okay, but promise me that you will give me all the information I want.”</p>

    <p>“Yes, I will be glad if I can be useful to you.”</p>

    <p>“Alright. When Dad and Mom disappeared, Bhua ji (father’s sister) took me to a different country and raised me there. Then I started my journey to find the truth about what happened on The Day Hell Opened and I was never able to get any usable information. On my 24th birthday Bhua ji said that it was time for me to learn the truth. She told me about you — that you were my father’s best friend, comrade-in-arms, and the only one who could tell me the truth. Now that I have explained everything, Chacha ji, it is your turn to tell me about that day.”</p>

    <p>“I will tell you about it, but it will be a long story and not a pleasant story that anyone would want to listen to.”</p>

    <p>“No problem. I just want to find the truth about what happened then, and it might help me understand how my father used to be.”</p>

    <p>“Hahaha, I’ll say the determination you have came directly from your father. He looks very familiar to you and even the way you talk and think matches him.”</p>

    <p>“Let’s start — it was the year 2098, Earth Venta.”</p>
