      <p>The dim glow of enchanted lanterns flickered across the dusty shelves of Armaan Singh’s library, casting long shadows over ancient tomes and relics. The old man, in his late fifties, bore every wrinkle and grey streak that told a story of time. Slumped in his favorite armchair, he watched his servant prepare his favourite herbal tea.</p>

      <p>It was a quiet evening. Armaan murmured, “Back in the old days, quiet was a luxury... or a curse.”</p>

      <p>A sharp ring echoed through the house — the doorbell, insistent and out of place in the stillness. He heaved himself up, joints creaking like old hinges, and opened the door.</p>

      <p>With a twist of the knob, the door opened, revealing a young man in his late twenties standing on the threshold. Tall, sharp, and eyes carrying the weight of a killer.</p>

      <div class="dialogue">
        <strong>Armaan:</strong> “Who are you? State your business, lad.”
      </div>

      <p>The young man tilted his head, a faint, knowing smile playing on his lips. He had long golden hair that caught the evening light.</p>

      <div class="dialogue">
        <strong>Armaan:</strong> “Hold on... I think I’ve seen you before. Those features — they scream of my old comrade-in-arms, Aditya Sharma.”
      </div>

      <div class="dialogue">
        <strong>Abhijeet:</strong> “You are sharper than you look, Chacha Armaan. I am the one who’s been chasing the most precious thing in my life, lost to time and betrayal. I’m strong on the outside, forged in battles that would break lesser men, but inside... I am the son of your old friend Aditya Sharma. My name is Abhijeet Sharma. Nice to meet you, Armaan Chacha.”
      </div>

      <p>Armaan froze — the words hit him like slamming into a collapsing estate wall. “Aditya’s son... Oh my God, you are alive! Where have you been all these years?”</p>

      <p>His mind flooded with memories of the days Armaan and Aditya shared; his eyes filled with tears.</p>

      <div class="dialogue">
        <strong>Abhijeet:</strong> “Chacha ji, are you okay? Why are you crying?”
      </div>

      <p>Abhijeet explained his journey: the disappearance of his parents, the exile to a distant country with his aunt, and his return.</p>

      <div class="dialogue">
        <strong>Abhijeet:</strong> “When Dad and Mom disappeared, Bhua ji took me to a different country. Now that I have explained everything, Chacha ji, it is your turn to tell me about that day.”
      </div>

      <div class="dialogue">
        <strong>Armaan:</strong> “I will tell you about it, but it will be a long story and not a pleasant story that anyone would want to listen to.”
      </div>

      <p>Armaan paused, collected himself, and then nodded, preparing to tell the story.</p>

      <p>“Let’s start — it was the year 2098, Earth Venta.”</p>
